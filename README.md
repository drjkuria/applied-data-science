# Applied Data Science with Python

This repository contains the code for Applied Data Science with Python, by IBM CognitiveClass. It contains all the code files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the course
This is a three-part course of the Applied Data Science with Python learning path. The course focuses on getting hands-on experience using the Python for introductory Data
Science. The repository constitutes the following three courses in their respective directories.

> - **Python for Data Science**
> - **Data Analysis with Python**
> - **Data Visualization with Python**

The code samples have been tested using Python 3.7.3

### Some important Python libraries
> - NumPy
> - SciPy
> - Pandas
> - Jupyter
> - Matplotlib
> - Seaborn


## Installation

If you have an existing Python 3.7.x installation on a Unix-like system, you can install the above libraries using pip:
